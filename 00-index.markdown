# Why a new 1D stellar evolution code?

The MESA Manifesto discusses the motivation for the MESA project,
outlines a MESA code of conduct, and describes the establishment of a
MESA Council.  Before using MESA, you should read the
[manifesto document](/assets/mesa_manifesto.pdf).  Here's a brief
extract of some of the key points

Stellar evolution calculations remain a basic tool of broad impact for
astrophysics.  New observations constantly test the models, even in
1D.  The continued demand requires the construction of a general,
modern stellar evolution code that combines the following advantages:

* **Openness**: anyone can download sources from the website.

* **Modularity**: independent modules for physics and for numerical
  algorithms; the parts can be used stand-alone.

* **Wide Applicability**: capable of calculating the evolution of
  stars in a wide range of environments.

* **Modern Techniques**: advanced AMR, fully coupled solution for
  composition and abundances, mass loss and gain, etc.

* **Comprehensive Microphysics**: up-to-date, wide-ranging, flexible,
  and independently useable microphysics modules.

* **Performance**: runs well on a personal computer and makes
  effective use of parallelism with multi-core architectures.

Users are encouraged to add to the capabilities of MESA, which will
remain a community resource. However, use of MESA requires adherence
to the MESA code of conduct:

* That all publications and presentations (research, educational, or
  outreach) deriving from the use of MESA acknowledge the MESA
  Instrument papers.

* That user modifications and additions are given back to the
  community.

* That users alert the MESA Council about their publications, either
  pre-release or at the time of publication.

* That users make available in a timely fashion (e.g., online at the
MESA website) all information needed for others to recreate their MESA
results -- "open know how" to match "open source."

* That users agree to help others learn MESA, giving back as the
  project progresses.

# What are the official roles in MESA?
<a name="roles"></a>

There are a few defined roles in the MESA community.

## 1st Author
<a name="role-1au"></a>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/paxton">Bill Paxton</a></li>
</ul>

The 1st author is the primary developer of MESA and the first author
on the MESA instrument papers

## Area Steward
<a name="role-steward"></a>

<ul>
  <li><i>Asteroseismology</i>: <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend">Rich Townsend</a></li>
  <li><i>Binaries</i>: Pablo Marchant Campos</li>
  <li><i>Microphysics</i>: <a href="http://cococubed.asu.edu/">Frank Timmes</a></li>
  <li><i>Website</i>: <a href="https://yoshiyahu.org/">Josiah Schwab</a></li>
</ul>

A MESA area steward has a prime role in the development of an area of
MESA and also has responsibility for responding to user bug reports
and requests for help related to that area.

## Council
<a name="role-council"></a>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/bildsten/">Lars Bildsten</a></li>
  <li>Aaron Dotter</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.astro.uvic.ca/~fherwig/">Falk Herwig</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://cococubed.asu.edu/">Frank Timmes</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://web.pa.msu.edu/people/ebrown/">Ed Brown</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend">Rich Townsend</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.matteocantiello.com/">Matteo Cantiello</a></li>
</ul>


The MESA Council consists of those engaged in working towards the
shared missions outlined here:

### Steward MESA

There are many ways this will be done: supporting the contributors,
maintaining the web access and web page updates, seeking enabling
funding, holding yearly working groups that allow for continued
engagement, documenting MESA development in the refereed literature,
and sustaining advanced development.

### Interface with the User Community

This starts with [answering questions from users][answering],
[developing a way to accept new code in an integrated
fashion][developing], [maintaining a user registry][maps], and
identifying new MESA Council members from those most active and
engaged in the intelligent use of MESA.

[developing]:http://cococubed.asu.edu/mesa_market/add-ons.html
[maps]:/prereqs.html#maps

### Enable Scientific Research and Education with MESA

Promote MESA and its goals, e.g., through scientific contributions at
relevant conferences.  Identify science opportunities that match MESA
capabilities and facilitate and encourage appropriate collaborative
activities.  [Track the science carried out by the community with MESA][science].
