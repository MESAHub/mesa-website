Revision 8845 has been designated a MESA release version.

The full release notes are available in [this mailing list post][notes].

[notes]:https://lists.mesastar.org/pipermail/mesa-users/2016-June/006691.html

+ In order to improve the clarity and uniformity of MESA inlist options, names using "cnt" were changed to use "interval" (e.g., `terminal_cnt` was renamed to `terminal_interval`).  For the same reasons, the option `photostep` was renamed to `photo_interval`.  A simple find-and-replace will bring your inlists up-to-date.  If one needs to make the changes in a more automated fashion, a sample migration script is included in the release annoucement to mesa-users.

+ In the binary module, adjustments were made to the Eddington mass
accretion rate to take into account black hole spins.
