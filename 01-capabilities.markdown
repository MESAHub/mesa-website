# What kinds of things can MESA do?

For a brief summary of the capabilities of MESA, take a look at this
[presentation by Matteo Cantiello](assets/mesa_slides.pdf).  (He has
also provided a [Keynote version](assets/mesa_slides.key.zip).)

The full capabilities of MESA are documented in the instrument papers.
Looking through the figures will give you a feel for the broad range
of problems that can be studied using MESA.

* [Paper 1 (Paxton et al. 2011)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P)
* [Paper 2 (Paxton et al. 2013)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJS..208....4P)
* [Paper 3 (Paxton et al. 2015)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJS..220...15P)
* [Paper 4 (Paxton et al. 2018)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJS..234...34P)

Additional capabilities are documented by MESA users in their publications

To give you yet more flavor of what MESA can do, here are some movies
made using png output from mesa/star.

## Evolve a 1 Msun star

This movie has more than you ever wanted to know about the evolution
of a 1 Msun star from pre-main sequence to cool white dwarf. (61MB)

## Evolve a 2 Msun star

Here is the evolution of a 2 Msun star from He core flash to cool
white dwarf with some nice thermal pulses at the tip of the AGB
(initial Z = 0.02). (40MB)

## Evolve a 16 Msun star

This one shows the evolution of a 16 Msun star from ZAMS to core
collapse (initial Z = 0.02 and ZAMS uniform rotation = 0.5 of
critical). (13MB)

## Accretion onto a neutron star

Now for something completely different, here is a movie showing rapid
accretion of pure helium onto a neutron star envelope leading to Type
I X-ray bursts. (10MB)

## Explosive Nucleosynthesis

This movie shows explosive nucleosynthesis with a 204 isotope net, as
discussed in Section 6.2.2 of Paper III. (1.5MB)
