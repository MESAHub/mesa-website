# What kinds of things can MESA do?

For a brief summary of the capabilities of MESA, take a look at this
[presentation by Matteo Cantiello](assets/mesa_slides.pdf).  (He has
also provided a [Keynote version](assets/mesa_slides.key.zip).)

The full capabilites of MESA are documented in the instrument papers.
Looking through the figures will give you a feel for the broad range
of problems that can be studied using MESA.

* [Paper 1 (Paxton et al. 2011)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P)
* [Paper 2 (Paxton et al. 2013)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJS..208....4P)

To give you some more flavor of what MESA can do, here are some movies
made using png output from mesa/star.

## Evolve a 1 Msun star

This movie has more than you ever wanted to know about the evolution
of a 1 Msun star from pre-main sequence to cool white dwarf. (61MB)

## Evolve a 2 Msun star

Here is the evolution of a 2 Msun star from He core flash to cool
white dwarf with some nice thermal pulses at the tip of the AGB
(initial Z = 0.02). (40MB)

## Evolve a 16 Msun star

This one shows the evolution of a 16 Msun star from zams to core
collapse (initial Z = 0.02 and ZAMS uniform rotation = 0.5 of
critical). (13MB)

## Accretion onto a neutron star

Now for something completely different, here is a movie showing rapid
accretion of pure helium onto a neutron star envelope leading to Type
I X-ray bursts. (10MB)
